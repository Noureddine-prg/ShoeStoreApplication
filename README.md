Shoe Store Application -

Variable Naming Convention - camel case ( ex: setAge )

Git Hub Version Control - If you find any errors here as well please correct me.

Important: To keep up to date with the project before you start working on it, make sure to git pull.

Typically when working on your separate task, you will do so in your own branch.

To switch to respective branch do: //Lincoln git checkout lincoln-branch

//Noureddine git checkout noureddine-branch

//main branch git checkout main

This makes sure we push all final changes to the main branch of our project. We do this to avoid any accidental errors on the final product.

Once we finish our task and test it properly, we will merge it onto the main branch.

To do this

Go to -> Main branch git checkout main

Merge intended branch git merge [branch name]

Afterwards you delete your merged branch with this command:

git branch -d [branch name] 

Create new branch whenever needed (new feature, debugging, etc.)

git checkout -b [name]
